# Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetic Retinopathy is a common condition faced by many in India. It is a leading cause for blindness and is often detected too late. The Aravind Eye Hospital in India released a dataset in 2019 of images taken using fundus photography in rural India by clinicians from the hospital. These images are ranked 0 - 4 (corresponding to no diabetic retinopathy (DR), mild DR, moderate DR, severe DR, proliferative DR respectively). We will use these images to train a Convolutional Neural Network to detect early Diabetic Retinopathy. A deployment of this model can potentially ease the workload for many optometrists and help people get the care that they need to potentially cure this condition.
